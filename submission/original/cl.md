This work, which is derived from my doctoral dissertation, presents a rigorous analysis of archaeological research practice, specifically relating to the constitution of archaeological data in fieldwork settings and the apparatus through which data are managed. My qualitative analysis is based on observations of and elicitations about archaeological data work practices, collected over several years. It is directly relevant to discourse surrounding practical and theoretical aspects of digital archaeology and the open data movement, and includes insights that are directly pertinent to the continuing development of data management infrastructures. As an ambitious contribution to archaeological theory and interpretation, it falls under the journal's stated mandate.

This work is derived from my doctoral dissertation titled Archaeological data work as continuous and collaborative practice (https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/130306). This is a new submission and no material contained within the manuscript has appeared in a peer-reviewed journal before. Other work relating to the dissertation has been published and is in review elsewhere, but the text does not overlap with that which is contained in other submissions.

Since this work is derived from my work conducted at the University of Toronto, the APC is 100% covered by the deal between Cambridge University Press and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network.
