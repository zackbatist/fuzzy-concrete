# Discussion and Conslusion
This paper's findings demonstrate how the production of stable and concrete archaeological records involves characterizing the phenomena of interest in nominal terms, while downplaying the situated and embodied experiences that informed the records' creation.
More specifically, it documents a tendency toward enforcing formally-defined records in support of analytical tasks down the line, which present fieldwork as a means to an end, and fieldworkers as instruments that can be wielded to support future analytic endeavours.
It shows how these values are instilled through the social and material experiences in which fieldwork is embedded, which inform fieldworkers about how their labour, and the outcomes of their labour, contribute to collective efforts.
In other words, it reveals how the management of archaeological data and of archaeological labour are inherently intertwined, and draws attention to some mechanisms through which certain voices are rendered more visible than others when constituting the archaeological record.

A key findings is that the fieldworkers I observed and spoke with played into the roles they were assigned, even though this meant having less creative agency.
In fact, the fieldworkers I spoke with generally valued their contributions as sensory devices, which is linked to the notion that they were capable of seeing things as they really are --- as material entities that have seemingly not yet been ascribed stable meaning.
As such, fieldworkers actively contributed to honing the illusion of their objectivity, which enhanced their value as members of the project and as domain specialists with their own unique mental skills.
At the same time, it was also clear that fieldworkers knew, on an intuitive level, that any claim of objectivity is overstated [as per complementary work published in @batist2024a: 12].
However, their positions as responsive rather than creative actors ensured that they are not responsible for resolving this tension [cf. @batist-alienation].

This paper contributes to a broader argument that systemic workflows, which effectively establish disciplined ways of working according to pre-defined targeted outcomes, have emerged as one strategy that archaeologists rely on to cope with a widespread epistemic anxiety concerning the nature of archaeological data.
More specifically, archaeologists struggle to reconcile two competing notions of data: as concrete, disembodied and stable records in one sense, as as situated products of decisions, actions and circumstances in another [@huggett2022a].
Archaeologists sense this anxiety most acutely in contexts of data analysis, especially at distance from the contexts of the data's creation, whereby they must either acknowledge of sweep aside the complex and storied histories of the data they are made to work with [@batist2024b].

Whereas this paper documents how archaeologists attempt to resolve this tension in the domain of data collection during fieldwork, it complements similar studies that focus on data documentation and dissemination practices.
For instance, studies investigating attempts to enhance archaeological documentation have suggested that these efforts should be directed by specific contexts of re-use [@huvila2022b; @austin2024; @opitz2021], and studies that surveyed with the needs of data re-users highlighted their need to communicate directly with the data's originators to ascertain the subtext hidden between the lines of their formal documentation [@faniel2012: 299-301; @atici2013: 676-677; @kansa2013: 90-91; @chapman2016: 213].
A common thread across this body of work is a suggestion to engage in discursive, and possibly even collaborative, relationships with those who wish to reuse data, thereby bridging the epistemic distance imposed by layers of abstraction.
Strategies for enhancing data's re-use potential across the continuum of archaeological practice thereby embody Dallas' [-@dallas2015] notion of curation as simultaneous acts of reconciliation and anticipation, whereby meanings are negotiated in relation to the prior and future objectives and circumstances.
Whereas studies of data documentation and re-use have focused on the leap from published dataset to contexts of reuse, this paper addresses how these concerns reach back and impact the constitution of data during earlier phases of work, namely fieldwork.

To be clear, the instrumentalization of archaeological labour (in fieldwork or elsewhere) is not necessarily a bad thing; as I have already noted, it is often necessary in order to derive concrete and confident records that are suitable for analytical methods which comply with modern scientific quality standards.
Moreover, information commons, such as the pool of knowledge accumulated throughout an archaeological project, do not necessarily have to be egalitarian, and are always governed by norms and expectations concerning who may contribute to and extract from communal resources, and in what ways these interactions should occur.
As such, rather than advocating for equilibrating agency across project systems, this paper encourages greater recognition of data work that occurs in domains that are not typically recognized for their capacity to work with data.
